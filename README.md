# 👋 Hi, I’m Aaron Voborny (aka **buffnerd**)

☁️ **Cloud Developer | Automation Engineer | Security-Minded Technologist**  

I build **cloud-native** and **on-prem** automation programs with a focus on **security, reliability, and scalability**. From Python toolkits that harden AWS environments to PowerShell toolkits for on-prem IT ops, I turn complex problems into clean, reusable solutions.
