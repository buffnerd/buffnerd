# 👋 Hi, I’m Aaron Voborny (aka **buffnerd**)

☁️ **Cloud Developer | Automation Engineer | Security-Minded Technologist**  
I build **cloud-native automation** with a focus on **security, reliability, and scale**. From Python toolkits that harden AWS to PowerShell portfolios for hands-on IT ops, I turn complex problems into clean, reusable solutions.

## 🔥 Featured (Python) — AWS Security Hardening Toolkit
### [AWS-Security-Hardening](https://github.com/buffnerd/AWS-Security-Hardening)
A collection of **idempotent Python/boto3 scripts** to rapidly improve AWS security posture:

- GuardDuty enablement (all regions)  
- Security Hub enablement + FSBP/CIS standards  
- S3 Block Public Access (account + buckets)  
- IAM MFA report + optional access-key disable  
- EC2 Security Group audit & remediation  
- CloudTrail multi-region logging with validation  

> Built to be **Lambda-ready**, **CI/CD-friendly**, and easy to demo for recruiters/engineering leaders.
