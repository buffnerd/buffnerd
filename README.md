# 👋 Hi, I’m Aaron Voborny (aka **buffnerd**)

☁️ **Cloud Developer | Automation Engineer | Security-Minded Technologist**  
I build **cloud-native automation** with a focus on **security, reliability, and scale**. From Python toolkits that harden AWS to PowerShell portfolios for hands-on IT ops, I turn complex problems into clean, reusable solutions.

## 🔥 Featured (Python) — AWS Security Hardening Toolkit
### [AWS-Security-Hardening](https://github.com/buffnerd/AWS-Security-Hardening)
A collection of **idempotent Python/boto3 scripts** to rapidly improve AWS security posture:

- GuardDuty enablement (all regions)
- Security Hub enablement + FSBP/CIS standards
- S3 Block Public Access (account + buckets)
- IAM MFA report + optional access-key disable
- EC2 Security Group audit & remediation
- CloudTrail multi-region logging with validation

> Built to be **Lambda-ready**, **CI/CD-friendly**, and easy to demo for recruiters/engineering leaders.

## 🧰 PowerShell Portfolio — Automation & Security
### [Powershell-Automation-Projects](https://github.com/buffnerd/Powershell-Automation-Projects)
A curated monorepo of my **PowerShell** work for enterprise IT and security. Highlights include:

- **Identity & Administration**  
  - Creating/modifying/deleting users; bulk updates (proxyAddresses, etc.)
  - Restoring critical **Active Directory** and **SQL** data
- **Monitoring & Telemetry**  
  - Domain Controller failed-login monitoring & reporting  
  - EventLog → GeoIP enrichment for failed RDP attempts  
  - **Sysmon** XML configurations for SIEM optimization
- **Security & Hardening**  
  - Deprecating **TLS 1.0/1.1** safely across environments  
  - Azure security administration automation
- **Networking & Access**  
  - Creating/activating/deactivating **VPN proxy chains**

> Each project lives in its own folder with scripts and a README for quick use.
